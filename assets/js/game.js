// window.alert ("This is an alert! JavaSript is running!")
// now is time to move to something more intresting! ;-)

// Promt for robot name
// window.prompt ("What is your robot's name?");

//use same script from above and create varible
var playerName = window.prompt ("What is your robot's name?");
//window.alert (playerName);
// use cosole log to log input
console.log ("This logs a string, good as testing to leave message to your self");
//this can do math
console.log(10+20);
// This will write robot's name in sonsole
console.log("My robot's name is " + playerName);

//this create a fuction named "fight"
function fight() {
